In this project, I build a neural network from scratch in the first section and another neural networking using in-built PyTorch methods in the second section. I evaluate the first NN on the XOR dataset to demonstrate NNs' general ability to solve the XOR problem, and I evaluate the second NN on the famous iris dataset, as it demonstrate NNs' strong performance on more complex datasets.
